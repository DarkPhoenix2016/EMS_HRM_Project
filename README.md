# Employee Management System

## Project Overview

The Employee Management System is a comprehensive desktop application designed for small businesses to efficiently manage their employee-related tasks. This project is implemented in Java and utilizes a networked SQL database for data storage. The system offers two interfaces—one for administrative personnel and another for user employees—both seamlessly integrated into the same database.

## Key Features

1. **Database Configuration:**
   - Configure the SQL database connection through a user-friendly GUI.
   - Default connection values provided with customization options.

2. **Administrative Interface:**
   - Dedicated interface for administrative users to manage employee-related information.
   - Modules include employee details, education, designations, salary, attendance, leaves, and user accounts.

3. **User Employee Interface:**
   - Separate login interface for employees to access personal details, attendance records, and salary slips.

4. **Database Views:**
   - Pre-defined SQL views for consolidated data retrieval, including employee current details and attendance status.

5. **Reporting Modules:**
   - Reporting views for generating reports on employee details, attendance, and more.
   - Export reports in common formats such as PDF and Excel.

6. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Developed using Java Swing or JavaFX for an intuitive and consistent user experience.

7. **Security and Configuration:**
   - Configure database connection and security settings through the application's settings section.
   - Implementation of security measures for secure database access and user authentication.

8. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Scalable design with provisions for future enhancements and additional features.
   - Regular updates can be easily integrated into the application.

## Project Development Plan

The development plan outlines tasks, timelines, and responsibilities for each team member. It covers database setup, user interface development, module implementation, testing, documentation, and deployment.

## Collaboration and Version Control

The team will collaborate using NetBeans as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and Git as the version control system. Regular code commits, code reviews, and collaborative development practices will ensure a streamlined development process.

## Conclusion

The Employee Management System aims to streamline and automate employee-related processes for small businesses. By providing a user-friendly interface and robust functionality, the system enhances efficiency, reduces manual work, and ensures accurate record-keeping.
